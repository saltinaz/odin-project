From The Odin Project's curriculum:
(https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors)

This project was to create a "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game that runs in a browser using JavaScript.

My take-away: A lot of basic JavaScript! This was a great introduction to concepts like scope and lots of useful things related to functional programming in general. This was a lot of fun to create.

For now, it only runs in the dev console, but later on in the curriculum I'll be adding a front end to it.
