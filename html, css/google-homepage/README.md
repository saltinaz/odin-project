From The Odin Project's curriculum:
(http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

This project is to re-create a (non-functional) Google search page as accurately as possible.

Skills I learned: HTML + CSS basics (re-familiarized), git basics (using WSL integration---was at first using a VM with Ubuntu but it was too unwieldy), various developer tool tricks, probably myriad other things I can't think of.
